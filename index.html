          <p>  Old Bay Seasoning, a blend of herbs and spices, was created by Gustav Brunn, a German immigrant in 1939. Prior to immigrating to the US, Brunn started a wholesale spice and seasoning business in Wertheim, Germany. Following the rise of Nazi power, Brunn moved his company to Frankfurt, Germany. However, not shortly after he escaped Nazi concentraction camps during WWII and relocated to Baltimore, MD where he founded the Baltimore Spice Company. There he produced “Delicious Brand Shrimp and Crab Seasoning”, which today is called Old Bay. The seasoning is named after the Old Bay Line, a passenger ship line that ferried passengers from the Chesapeake Bay in Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia. In 1990, McCormick & Co purchased the seasoning brand. To this day, it is still produced. With 8.3 million units sold each year, Old Bay is found worldwide. Old Bay is not an ordinary seasoning to most, it is used as a versatile blend to enhance almost anything including my personal favorite, crab dip. </p>
